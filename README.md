Just a couple of Advent of Code puzzles solved in C. When possible I try to use non obvious ways to solve the puzzle, to make things more creative:

* Day 1 makes use of a simple streaming algorithm to retain top-N max entries.
* Day 2 turns the logic of Rock, Paper, Scissor into a simple equation modulo N.
* Day 3 makes use of bitmaps.
* Day 4 shows abstracting with C structures.
